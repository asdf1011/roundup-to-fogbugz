Convert a roundup issue database to a fogbugz database
======================================================

This program will;

* Import all roundup users.
* Import the history for all issues, including;
   - Title
   - Messages
   - Priority
   - Status
   - Assigned to
   - Keywords
   - Attachments
* Can optionally allow mapping of keywords to projects (in which case it will
  create those projects, assign the bug to the project, and remove the
  keyword from the tags).
* Attempt to keep the same issue numbers.

It will not;

* Import passwords.
* Keep the nosy list (this wasn't required for us, but it'll be easy to add).
* Remove messages from issues (supported by roundup, but not by fogbugz).
* Import non-default classes (should be easy to customise though).


Instructions
============

Export the roundup database using roundup-admin. eg:

  roundup-admin export export_dir/

Then use roundup-to-fogbugz.py tool to test the conversion;

  ./roundup-to-fogbugz --default-project=ProjectA --map projecta:ProjectA --map projectb:ProjectB --default-user=usera ./export_dir

This will not import into fogbugz, but it will scan the history of the issue
tracker and check it for sanity. When this has run without error, and you'd
like to import it into fogbugz, run

  ./roundup-to-fogbugz --default-project=ProjectA --map projecta:ProjectA --map projectb:ProjectB --default-user=usera --fogbugz-server=http://localhost:1234/bugs/api.xml ./export_dir

replacing the fogbugz server with the current url.
